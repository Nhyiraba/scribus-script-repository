# Scribus API Mock

A class that allows you to develop Scribus scripts outside of Scribus.

The commands are all dummy and do not act on any document.

## Usage

Include the `scribus.py` file and create a `scribus = Scribus()` object.

## Status

Only few commands are "implemented" yet. Feel free to make pull requests!
