This script irreversibly scrambles your text on all pages of the current Scribus document.

You would be wise to work on a copy of the original to avoid 
accidentally saving this scrambled version only to lose the original.

v3 is the most up to date 

## Todo

- [ ] probably merge the three version and keep the best one
- [ ] rename the script to match the name of the directory (which better fits the goal of the script)
- [ ] show an alert explaining that the script makes the document unreadable.
- [ ] only run the script if the current document has been saved.
- [ ] the default action is to "Save as" after the dialog. But give an option not to do so.
- [ ] eventually, also scramble the images by pulling images from a free resources.
