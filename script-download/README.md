# plans


since the new scripter currently does not run, i'll be creating python / pyqt program that will be listing and downloading scripts from the same github repository mentioned above.

it should be easy to get that script to run inside of scribus, once scribus itself will be ready.

the plan is to:

- define a metadata file for each script (directory) and (possibly) one for the full repository
- define and create dialogs for managing the (list of ) repository(ies) and the local storage.
- write the code that downloads the scripts (through http or git?),
- and to detect which scripts should be updated.


# The repository's structure

- manifest.json
- README.md
- the-script/
  - the-script.py
  - README.md
  - other-files/

Remarks:
- The names are case sensitive
- Only the main script file should be directly placed in the script's directory. All other files that are to be downloaded, should be in one sub-directory.

# Downloading the files

- When downloading a script, only the files listed in the manifest are downloaded

# Running the script
